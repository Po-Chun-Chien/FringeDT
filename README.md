# FringeDT
An implementation of binary decision tree with fringe-features extraction.

## Introduction
This repository contains one of the methods we used in the [IWLS 2020](https://iwls20.cade.utah.edu/) Programming Contest.
We train a binary binary decision tree with fringe-features extraction proposed in [[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2), and convert it into a Boolean logic circuit.
You may also refer to our DATE'19 paper [[3]](#ref3) (written with other contestants) and the [project page](https://po-chun-chien.github.io/projects/5.ML+LS/) for more details.
